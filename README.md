-- Development Timeline --

Most time went on working with hooks so there are no unnececary re-renders and structuring the application and relating each reply, tags, users to respective parent data correctly.

Each module took for approx 4 hours.

Since working on multiple projects couldn't track exact timing, reconsidering old sollutions also also played role.
